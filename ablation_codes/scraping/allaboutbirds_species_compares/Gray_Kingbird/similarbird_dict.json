            "description": "Scissor-tailed Flycatchers usually have much longer tails than Gray Kingbirds, but young and molting individuals can have short tails. Note Scissor-tailed's smaller bill, frosty head without mask through eye, and salmon-red highlights on flanks and under wing. The normal ranges of the two species have very little overlap."
