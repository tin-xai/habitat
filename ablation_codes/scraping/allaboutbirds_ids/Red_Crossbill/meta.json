Adult males perch on top of conifers to sing and watch for predators. Red Crossbills sometimes attend feeders that offer sunflower seed, especially in the West.",

            "Ornithologists have discovered that different crossbill populations, some of them previously defined as subspecies, have distinctly different flight calls and bill shapes that are adapted for different types of cones. They now term these different groups \u201ctypes,\u201d rather than subspecies. In some cases, these types behave like full species\u2014that is, only breeding with others of their type. Scientists call this assortative mating. In 2015, the \u201ctype 9\u201d Red Crossbill, known only from Idaho, was elevated to the status of full species, Cassia Crossbill. Studies are now focused on the degrees of difference between the other 10 North American (and more than a dozen Eurasian) types of Red Crossbill. It is possible that more types will become recognized as full species. Currently, field identification of a Red Crossbill type requires a recording of its flight call.",
