            "Large flycatcher with heavy bill. Gray above, white below, with brown wings and tail. Often shows dark mask through eye and onto cheek.",
            "Large gray-brown flycatcher with big head and heavy bill, giving a bull-headed look. Tail often appears notched and does not show white at the tip.",
            "Sits on exposed perches in open and semiopen habitats, often around humans. With small movements of the head, scans for flying insects and then flies out after them in pursuit.",
            "Color pattern is distinctive: uniform gray upperparts, with dark mask through eye, and white underparts. Note heavy bill, even compared with other kingbirds. Tail lacks white edges and tip.",
            "Juveniles often have cinnamon to brownish margins on the wing coverts and uppertail coverts.",
            "Juveniles have cinnamon to brownish margins on the wing coverts and uppertail coverts. Note also the yellowish gape at the base of the bill on this recently fledged individual.",
            "Pursues flying insects on long aerial chases. In flight, note white underparts, gray upperparts, and relatively short tail lacking both white outer tail feathers and white terminal band.",
            "Eats mostly flying insects, often caught on long aerial chases. Fairly conspicuous in open and semiopen coastal areas, mangroves, and towns."
