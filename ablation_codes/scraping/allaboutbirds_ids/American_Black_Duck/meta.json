            "These are dabbling ducks that tip up instead of dive when they forage. They eat aquatic plants, invertebrates, and occasionally small fish in shallow water. They also fly into agricultural fields to feed on waste corn and grain. Look for them mixed into flocks with other \u201cpuddle ducks\u201d such as Gadwall and Mallards."
