The southernmost, atricristatus, ranges from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas through much of central and eastern Mexico; it has dark gray flanks with an olive tint. The westernmost subspecies, paloduro, is found mostly from the Big Bend region of Texas into adjacent Mexico; it has dark gray flanks. The sennetti subspecies ranges from southern Oklahoma southward to central Texas. It has paler flanks and a rusty tint to the forehead.",
