It has a pale tan eyebrow stripe above the eye and a plain brown cap. Its unmarked throat and barred belly are pale tan, paler than the back."

            "Winter Wrens hop and scamper through the understory moving more like a mouse than a bird as they investigate upturned roots and decaying logs for food. These energetic birds often bob their entire bodies as if doing squats while they nervously look around in the forest understory. In flight they rapidly beat their tiny wings to move short distances between cover."
