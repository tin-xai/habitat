The head, nape, and breast are stippled or streaked with brown, but the flanks are white. Nonbreeding adults are much plainer, mousy grayish brown above, pale below, with weak supercilium (pale line over eye). Juveniles are similar to nonbreeding adult but the upperparts show a neat, scaly pattern.",
