This breeding male shows a dark-streaked back, butter yellow neck patch, black mask, and a rich dark bay color on the crown, throat, and flanks. Generally found in trees, preferring conifers during the breeding season, but may be found on the ground during migration.",

Though the black mask, yellowish neck patch, and chestnut throat and flanks create a very distinctive look for this breeding male, also note the buff tones of the undertail coverts and black-and-white tail pattern - these features are useful for ID in all plumages."

Additionally, the legs and feet are nondescript and dark, lacking strongly contrasting yellow soles to the feet.",
            "In late summer and fall, females and immatures are best identified by the low contrast yellow-green head, bold white wingbars, and plain, buff flanks and undertail coverts. Many also show a large amount of pale pink in the otherwise dark bill.",
            "Nonbreeding individuals can be hard to identify. When viewed from below, look for plain, unstreaked yellow-green plumage with buff-olive tones on the flanks and undertail coverts. Also, the largely pale bill and low contrast face pattern with just a slight dark eyeline are subtly distinctive."

The pale yellowish neck patch and bold swath of bay on the flank help to lock down the species ID."
