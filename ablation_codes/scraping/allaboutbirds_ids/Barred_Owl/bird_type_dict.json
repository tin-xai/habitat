            "Fairly large, with dark eyes and a yellow bill. Buffy below with dark streaks, and brown on the back with white mottling.",
            "Upperparts are brown with mottling, and the tail is brown with white barring.",
            "Mostly nocturnal, but sometimes active in morning and evening. Tends to sit quietly, swiveling head to listen for prey. Note round head and brown eyes.",
            "Often occurs as pairs throughout the year.",
            "Typically conceals itself amid branches and foliage to sleep during the day. Sometimes discovered by forest birds and mobbed or scolded; their calls can be a good way to find owls.",
            "Hunts for a variety of prey, including amphibians and fish.",
            "Typically occurs in well wooded habitats, but will come to edges and more open areas.",
            "Flies with broad, rounded wings. Big head and flat face gives a blunt-headed appearance in flight that can help distinguish from hawks."
