            "Greater Roadrunners spend most of their lives on the ground hunting lizards, small mammals, and birds. They are very fast runners, leaning over parallel to the ground with their tails streaming behind them. They are weak fliers, but you may see them perched above the ground on fence posts and sometimes telephone wires."
