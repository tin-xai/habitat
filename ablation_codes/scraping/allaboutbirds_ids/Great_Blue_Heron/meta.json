In flight, the Great Blue Heron curls its neck into a tight \u201cS\u201d shape; its wings are broad and rounded and its legs trail well beyond the tail."

            "Hunting Great Blue Herons wade slowly or stand statue-like, stalking fish and other prey in shallow water or open fields. Watch for the lightning-fast thrust of the neck and head as they stab with their strong bills. Their very slow wingbeats, tucked-in neck and trailing legs create an unmistakable image in flight."
