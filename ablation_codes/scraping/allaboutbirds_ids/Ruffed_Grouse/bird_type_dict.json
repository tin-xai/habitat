            "Medium-sized game bird with short crest. A well-camouflaged bird with intricately barred and spotted plumage. Individuals can be grayish brown overall, reddish brown, or an intermediate tawny brown.",
            "When not displaying, sexes are difficult to tell apart. Often forages among tree branches during winter, especially when snow covers the ground.",
            "Often bathes in dust or lies on anthills (\"anting\"), fluffing feathers to clean them.",
            "Medium-sized game bird with peaked crest, pale line through the eye, and dark band near tip of tail. Sometimes forages in trees, especially in winter, taking berries and buds.",
            "Lives in forest undergrowth where it can be very difficult to see; often most easily seen when crossing roads."

            "Males typically perform a \"drum display\" atop a raised surface such as a log or stump. Ruffed Grouse do not produce the drumming sound by hitting their wings against their body, but rather by creating miniature sonic booms while pumping their wings back and forth."
