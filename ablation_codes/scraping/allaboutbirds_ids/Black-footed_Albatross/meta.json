            "Albatrosses have a very distinctive flight style known as dynamic soaring. They rarely flap their wings except in very light winds. They typically fly low to the water, sometimes down in the wave troughs, and then swoop up into the sky, catch the wind, and accelerate downwind before swooping low to the water again. Often forages in groups, sometimes mixed with other seabirds and marine mammals."
