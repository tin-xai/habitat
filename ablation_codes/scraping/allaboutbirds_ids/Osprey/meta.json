The head is white with a broad brown stripe through the eye. Juveniles have white spots on the back and buffy shading on the breast."

            "Ospreys search for fish by flying on steady wingbeats and bowed wings or circling high in the sky over relatively shallow water. They often hover briefly before diving, feet first, to grab a fish. You can often clearly see an Osprey's catch in its talons as the bird carries it back to a nest or perch."
