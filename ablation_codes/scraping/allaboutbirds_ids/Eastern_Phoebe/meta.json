The head often appears flat on top, but phoebes sometimes raise the feathers up into a peak. Like most small flycatchers, they have short, thin bills used for catching insects."

            "The Eastern Phoebe generally perches low in trees or on fencelines. Phoebes are very active, making short flights to capture insects and very often returning to the same perch. They make sharp \u201cpeep\u201d calls in addition to their familiar \u201cphoebe\u201d vocalizations. When perched, Eastern Phoebes wag their tails down and up frequently."
