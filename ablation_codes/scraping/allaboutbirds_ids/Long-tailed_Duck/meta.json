            "Males in winter are mostly white and black: the head is white with a large dark patch on the neck. The breast and body are dark with white plumes covering the back. The bill is mostly black with a pink band. Males in summer are infrequently seen away from the Arctic, but are roughly the reverse of their winter plumage, with a dark head, neck, and body, and a white face patch. Females and young males are smudgy brown on the body with a white face, a brown crown and cheek patch, and a dark bill.",
