The black-and-white-striped head is augmented by a bright white throat and yellow between the eye and the bill, which is gray. You\u2019ll also see a less boldly marked form, known as \u201ctan-striped,\u201d with a buff-on-brown face pattern instead of white-on-black."

            "Look for White-throated Sparrows in woods, at forest edges, in the regrowth that follows logging or forest fires, at pond and bog edges, and in copses near treeline. In winter you can find these birds in thickets, overgrown fields, parks, and woodsy suburbs. They readily come to backyards for birdseed."
