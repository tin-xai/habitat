The color is richer on the head, paler on the underparts; their tails are bluish. Both sexes have two wingbars; the upper is chestnut and the lower is grayish to buffy. Immature Blue Grosbeaks tend to a rich, dark chestnut brown, with chestnut wingbars."

            "Blue Grosbeaks are unobtrusive despite their bright colors, although in summer males frequently sing their pleasant, rich, warbling songs. Often they sing while perched at high points in the shrubs and small trees of their generally open or shrubby habitats. Listen for their loud, almost metallic chink call. Also watch for this species\u2019 odd habit of twitching its tail sideways."
