            "Small and stocky with a daggerlike bill and a thick neck that is often drawn into their body. Adults have a deep green back and crown, and a chestnut neck and breast.",
            "Look rather ungainly in flight, often partially uncrooking their necks to giving them a front-heavy appearance.",
            "The center of their neck is streaked, but the streaking can be hard to see as they frequently have their necks tucked in or they are crouched over making it difficult to see the center of the neck.",
            "Generally appears all dark, except in good light when the feathers shine with an almost iridescent green color."
