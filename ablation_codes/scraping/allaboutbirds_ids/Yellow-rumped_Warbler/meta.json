            "Yellow-rumped Warblers typically forage in the outer tree canopies at middle heights. They're active, and you'll often see them sally out to catch insects in midair, sometimes on long flights. In winter they spend lots of time eating berries from shrubs, and they often travel in large flocks."

            "The Yellow-rumped Warbler has two distinct subspecies that used to be considered separate species: the \"Myrtle\" Warbler of the eastern U.S. and Canada's boreal forest, and \"Audubon\u2019s\" Warbler of the mountainous West. The Audubon\u2019s has a yellow throat; in the Myrtle subspecies the throat is white. Male \"Audubon's\" Warblers have more white in the wing than the \"Myrtle\" Warbler. Female Audubon's have less distinctly marked faces, lacking the dark ear patches of the \"Myrtle\" Warbler. Intermediate forms occur where the two subspecies' breeding ranges overlap, such as in the Canadian Rockies."
