Males have mostly red crowns; females have blackish crowns.",

Most of the time they stay hidden in vegetation as they forage and are usually detected first by their calls or by their rapid drumming on trees. Their flight is rapid, with an undulating pattern, but they don\u2019t tend to fly for long periods.",
