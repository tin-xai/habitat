The back is black but the sides are white, making the body appear mostly white. Females have brown heads and gray back and wings. The bill is black with variable amounts of yellow at the tip. In flight, both sexes have large white patches in the wings."

            "These are diving ducks that often forage in flocks and dive simultaneously. They tend to forage in fairly shallow waters (up to 20 feet deep). They are fast fliers; their wings make a distinctive whistling sound in flight. When females are nearby, males frequently display by stretching the head backward against their back and then popping their head forward.",
