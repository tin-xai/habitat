            "Ornithologists recognize six subspecies, three that have mostly grayish faces, three that have gray in the crown but brownish cheeks. Two of the gray-headed subspecies\u2014griseonucha and umbrina\u2014live on the Aleutian and the Pribilof Islands, respectively. These are both very large subspecies, weighing twice as much as the continental subspecies. The other gray-headed subspecies, the small littoralis, is often called \u201cHepburn\u2019s\u201d Rosy-Finch. It nests from mainland Alaska south to California. Three rather similar subspecies with gray crown markings and brown cheeks, tephrocotis, wallowa, and dawsoni, nest farther east, in interior mountains of the West.",
