The undersides of the wing and tail feathers are bright yellow, for eastern birds, or red, in western birds. With a closer look you\u2019ll see the brown plumage is richly patterned with black spots, bars, and crescents.",

            "North America has two easily distinguished races of Northern Flickers: the yellow-shafted form of the East, which occurs into Texas and the Great Plains, and the red-shafted form of the West. The key difference is the color of the flight-feather shafts, which are either a lemon yellow or a rosy red. Yellow-shafted forms have tan faces and gray crowns, and a red crescent on the nape. Males have a black mustache stripe. Red-shafted forms have a gray face, brown crown, and no nape crescent, with males showing a red mustache stripe. Hybrids look intermediate and are common at the edges of these two groups\u2019 ranges.",
