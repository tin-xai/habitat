            "There is a huge range of geographic variation in the Dark-eyed Junco. Among the 15 described races, six forms are easily recognizable in the field and five used to be considered separate species until the 1980s. A field guide is the best place to look for complete illustration of ranges and plumages, but in general there are two widespread forms of the Dark-eyed Junco: \u201cslate-colored\u201d junco of the eastern United States and most of Canada, which is smooth gray above; and \u201cOregon\u201d junco, found across much of the western U.S., with a dark hood, warm brown back and rufous flanks. Other more restricted variations include the slate-colored-like \u201cwhite-winged\u201d and Oregon-like \u201cpink-sided\u201d juncos of the Rockies and western Great Plains; and the Yellow-eyed Junco-like \u201cred-backed\u201d and \u201cgray-headed\u201d juncos of the Southwest."
