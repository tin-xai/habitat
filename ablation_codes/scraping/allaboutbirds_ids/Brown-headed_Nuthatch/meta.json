            "Nuthatches zigzag their way up and down tree trunks and branches high in the canopy, squeaking as they go. Although their calls aren\u2019t very loud there\u2019s usually more than one in a group calling at the same time, so they won't go unheard. They are social birds and often fly in shallow dips from tree to tree with one trailing behind the other."
