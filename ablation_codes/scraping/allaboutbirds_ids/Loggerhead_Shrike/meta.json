            "The Loggerhead Shrike is a gray bird with a black mask and white flashes in the black wings. The gray head contrasts with the wide, black mask, black bill, and white throat. The tail is black with white corners; the wings are black with white at the base of the primaries that form a small \u201chandkerchief\u201d spot when the wing is closed and larger white patches in flight. Juveniles have darker barring above and below."

            "Loggerhead Shrikes sit on low, exposed perches and scan for rodents, lizards, birds, and insects. They eat smaller prey (such as ground beetles) right away, but they are famous for impaling larger items on thorns or barbed wire to be eaten later. The species often hovers. When flying it uses bursts of very rapid wingbeats."

An endangered subspecies of Loggerhead Shrike from San Clemente Island, in southern California, is the darkest gray of all."
