They move fairly slowly and sit still as they shell seeds by crushing them with rapid bites. Flight is bouncy, like many finches."

Even though all of eastern North America\u2019s House Finches are descended from the same few birds released on Long Island (meaning they\u2019re much more closely related to each other than they are to birds across the West), there aren\u2019t any strong differences in size, shape, or color between the two regions."
