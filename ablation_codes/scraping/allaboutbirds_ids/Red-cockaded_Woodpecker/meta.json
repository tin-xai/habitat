Males have a tiny, nearly invisible red streak (\u201ccockade\u201d) at the upper border of the cheek. The back has strong horizontal black-and-white bars."

            "This endangered species is a habitat specialist that is strongly tied to old-growth pine forests that burn frequently, leaving the understory mostly clear of younger pines and hardwoods. They were once common in vast tracts of longleaf pine; now they also occur in loblolly, slash, and some other pine stands in the southeastern pine flatwoods."
