            "Veeries are inconspicuous forest birds except for their beautiful downward-spiraling song, which they give often in late spring and summer, especially at dusk and dawn. They forage on the ground and logs for invertebrate prey, somewhat in the manner of American Robin or Hermit Thrush, peering around, then moving a short distance and repeating the process. You may also hear their distinctive, scolding call note, a harsh veerr usually given from a hidden nook.",
