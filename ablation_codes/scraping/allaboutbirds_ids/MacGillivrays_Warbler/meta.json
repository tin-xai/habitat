Immatures are mostly olive brown above, with whitish eye arcs and a grayish or brownish version of the hood, broken up by a pale throat.",

            "Ornithologists currently recognize two subspecies: tolmiei that breeds on the west side of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, from Alaska to southern California (the Pacific Slope), and monticola that breeds east of that region, in the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia to Arizona. Plumage tones differ markedly, with tolmiei a saturated yellowish olive above and bright yellow below, and monticola more grayish olive above and a paler greenish yellow below. The small, isolated population in northern Mexico is genetically very distinct from the nearest U.S. populations and probably diverged over a million years ago, during the early Pleistocene.",
