            "Breeding adults have dove-gray heads and black upperparts marked with crisp white lines. The throat is black with sharp black-and-white lines down the sides. Crown and back of neck pale gray. The chin and throat can show a purple gloss. Eye dark red, bill and legs dark. Nonbreeding adults are dark gray-brown above with very little white feather edging; and whitish below, sometimes with a neat dark line or chinstrap across the throat. Juveniles are similar to nonbreeding adult but usually show neat pale edges to feathers.",
