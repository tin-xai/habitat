            "Kentucky Warblers forage mostly on the forest floor, hopping through leaf litter, flipping it with feet and bill, and probing to find hidden invertebrates. They also forage in the forest understory, picking at or flying out for small prey. Wintering birds frequently follow ant swarms, watching from a perch until an invertebrate is flushed by the ants."
