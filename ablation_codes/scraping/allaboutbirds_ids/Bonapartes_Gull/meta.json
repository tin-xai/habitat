Immatures are similar to nonbreeding adults but upperwing is edged in dark gray, and the tail is tipped in black.",

            "In the nonbreeding season, Bonaparte\u2019s Gulls form tight, swift flocks that feed largely on small fish by dipping and diving, sometimes stealing fish from other birds. Migrants can occur over many types of open water and even follow farm plows to take worms and insects. When breeding, they eat mainly aerial insects, which they capture in flight. In flight style and in their harsh calls, they resemble terns.",
