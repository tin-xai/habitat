            "Small and compact, with a thin, short bill. Black cap and bib contrast with white cheeks, gray back and wings, and light buffy underparts.",
            "Often moves acrobatically through small branches, and can perch sideways or upside-down.",
            "Song is a 2-noted, clear whistle, with the second note lower than the first.",
            "Bold black-and-white head pattern strongly contrasts with the rest of the plumage.",
            "Small bill and long tail impart a compact, rotund look. Note white-edged secondaries.",
            "Often visits feeders, including suet feeders. Note the extensive white edging to the feathers of the wing.",
            "Forages for seeds both on wild plants and bird feeders.",
            "Nests in holes in trees and nest boxes. Occurs in a wide variety of wooded and shrubby habitats.",
            "Often perches on or explores along slender twigs and weedy stems. Flockmates keep in contact using very short call notes.",
            "When agitated, chickadees scold with their chick-a-dee calls, or sometimes shorten the calls to a string of \"dee\" notes. These birds are responding to the call of an Eastern Screech-Owl."
