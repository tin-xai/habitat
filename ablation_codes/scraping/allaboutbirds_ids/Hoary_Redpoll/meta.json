            "Hoary Redpolls are pale whitish birds with gray-brown streaks. Adults have a small red patch on the forecrown. They have darker gray tail and wings, with bold white wingbars. Some individuals have a rosy tint to the rump and underparts, or a buff tint to the face and back. Adult females are less strikingly white overall than males. Juveniles are brownish and streaky, often with buff tones in the face.",
