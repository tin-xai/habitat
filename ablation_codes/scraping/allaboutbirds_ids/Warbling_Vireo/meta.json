            "Warbling Vireos are gray-olive above and whitish below, washed on the sides and vent with yellow. They have a dark line through the eye and a white line over the eye. The lores (the area between the eye and bill) are white in most individuals. Typically, the brightest plumage on Warbling Vireos is on vent or flanks. Worn midsummer birds can be nearly entirely gray above and whitish below."

            "Western birds tend to be a bit drabber than eastern birds, though plumage color varies more with season than from east to west. Western birds also have slightly longer bills, but this difference is only rarely useable in the field. The two forms have similar, but diagnosably different songs, western birds having higher-pitched, less \u201csing-songy,\u201d less caroling, and slightly longer songs than those of eastern birds. The two forms meet near the western edge of the Great Plains, and both forms breed in, at least, Colorado."
