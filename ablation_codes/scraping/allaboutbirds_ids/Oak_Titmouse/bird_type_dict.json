            "Small songbird with a short, stubby bill, a short crest, and a medium-long tail. Plain gray-brown overall, but paler below. Its beady black eye stands out on its plain face.",
            "Small crested songbird with a short, round bill. Rather nondescript gray-brown above and paler below. Frequently sings a scratchy and rapid song.",
            "Rather plain gray-brown bird with a crest that can be raised or lowered. In most cases the crest is at least partially visible, as in this individual.",
            "Flits between branches and trees, flying with a shallow undulating motion. Tends to feed among the woody twigs in the lower canopies of oaks and other trees.",
            "Plain gray-brown overall with paler underparts. Sometimes holds its crest down.",
            "Nests in holes in trees created naturally or excavated by woodpeckers. Sometimes they partially excavate a cavity in softer wood.",
            "Found in warm, open, dry oak or oak-pine woodlands."
