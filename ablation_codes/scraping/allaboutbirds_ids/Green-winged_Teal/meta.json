In good light, their dark heads are cinnamon with a wide green swoop from the eye to the back of the neck. Females are brown with a yellowish streak along the tail. Both sexes have green wing patches in the secondaries (speculum), but these may be hidden when not in flight."

Another subspecies from the Aleutian Islands shares these markings with \u201cCommon\u201d Teal."
