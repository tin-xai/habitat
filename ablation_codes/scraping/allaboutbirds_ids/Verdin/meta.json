The subspecies acaciarum is resident from southern California, Nevada, and Utah southward into Mexico; it is associated mostly with the Sonoran Desert. The subspecies ornatus is found from New Mexico and Oklahoma southward into Mexico and is associated more with the Chihuahuan Desert. The remaining 4-5 subspecies are resident in Mexico.",
