            "Adult in breeding plumage is mostly dark brown (black from a distance), with dark underwings and white patches in upperwings that are partly broken by a black bar. The feet and interior of the mouth are vivid scarlet. Adults in nonbreeding plumage retain white wing patches but have a mostly whitish head, neck, and underparts. Juveniles are similar but with grayish feathers on the head, neck, and sides and less white in the upperwing.",

            "The Pigeon Guillemot dives and swims underwater, flapping its wings for propulsion. It catches fish, worms, and crustaceans one at a time, seizing them from between rocks, among algae, or in the water. It usually forages alone and away from other species as well. Breeds in rocky crevices along the coast or on islands and feeds very near nest sites."
