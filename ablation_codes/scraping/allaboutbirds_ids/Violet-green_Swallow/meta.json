            "On first look, Violet-green Swallows appear dark above and crisp white below. In good light, the greenish-bronze back and iridescent violet rump come to life. All individuals have white bellies that wrap around to the upper side of the rump, creating \"saddlebags.\" Males have white cheek patches while females and juveniles have dusky cheeks. Juveniles have grayish-brown backs and crowns."
