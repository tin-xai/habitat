            "Note blackish-brown upperparts, messy black cap that extends below the bill, and extensive white flash on upper and underside of outer wing. Rare dark morph adult is entirely blackish-brown but still has white wing flashes. Immature birds are variable, but in general they are barred with brown above and have bold black-and-white bars on the underwing and undertail coverts. Typically shows white shafts on 6 to 8 outer wing feathers (more than other jaegers) and more obvious white flash on underwing.",
