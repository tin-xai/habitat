            "The many subspecies of Savannah Sparrow can range from pale gray-brown to rusty overall. \u201cIpswich\u201d Savannah Sparrows, which breed on islands in maritime Canada and winter along the East Coast, are large and pale gray-brown overall. \u201cBelding\u2019s\u201d Savannah Sparrows from saltmarshes of Southern California and Mexico are darker with heavier streaking and a thinner crown stripe. The range-restricted \u201cLarge-billed\u201d Savannah Sparrow of Mexico barely enters the United States in southern California; it has a much heavier bill than other forms of the species. All subspecies show thin, crisp streaking on the underparts and usually have yellow in front of the eye.",
