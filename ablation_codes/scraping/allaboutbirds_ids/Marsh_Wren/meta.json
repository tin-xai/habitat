They grasp stalks of vegetation, legs splayed with each foot wrapped around a different stalk. Males occasionally pop up to sing from taller cattails.

In general, individuals in the eastern United States are rustier and more brightly colored than individuals in the western U.S. Birds in the West also have a larger repertoire of songs that are harsher and more complex than those in the East (see Sounds). A small disjunct resident population also occurs in Mexico in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, and Puebla.",
