            "Somewhat stocky songbird with a thick, hooked bill. Adults in fresh plumage are bright yellow below with a yellow throat. The dark gray crown contrasts with the white eyebrow, though this can be indistinct on some birds.",

            "Often perches horizontally. Upperparts are brownish gray with unmarked wings. Underparts are washed in pale yellow; some individuals are brighter. Note white eyebrow and dark eye.",

            "Song is a steady series of roughly 3-note phrases that end on an upswing or downswing, as if the bird is asking and answering a question, over and over. It is similar to the songs of several other vireo species, including Red-eyed and Blue-headed.",
            "Hops between small twigs in trees and shrubs. This video has no audio.",
            "Jumps up to pick insects off leaves or grabs insects while perched. This video has no audio.",
            "Note the yellow underparts and plainer face; two features that help separate it from the similar looking Red-eyed Vireo. This video has no audio."
