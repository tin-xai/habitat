            "Rather chunky for a warbler with bold black spots on the chest, a white eyering, and a black and orange striped crown.",
            "Note bold black spots on the chest and black and orange striped crown, although crown color can be difficult to see.",
            "Song is a loud \"teacher, teacher, teacher\" that increases in volume as it goes on.",
            "Chunky, wide-eyed warbler with bold spotting on the chest, olive-brown upperparts and striped crown.",
            "Territorial males are very vocal, singing a loud \"teacher, teacher, teacher\" from tree branches, occasionally quite high up in the canopy.",
            "Typically forages on the ground in forest understory and leaf litter, walking with a hesitating gait.",
            "Breeds in closed-canopy forests, particularly deciduous and mixed deciduous-evergreen woods. Forages on the ground, often walking with a herky-jerky, wandering stroll.",
            "Note white eyering in otherwise unmarked face.",
            "Forages mainly by walking slowly through the leaf litter looking for concealed insects."
