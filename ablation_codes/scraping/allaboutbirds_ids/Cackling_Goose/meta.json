At night they roost with other geese on lakes, reservoirs, or wetlands.",

            "Four subspecies differ in size, structure, and plumage. The smallest and darkest subspecies, minima, breeds in western Alaska and winters in Oregon and California. The next smallest subspecies, leucopareia, breeds in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands and winters in central California. It is paler than minima, with a more distinctive white collar where the black neck meets the brown body. Subspecies hutchinsii, also called Richardson\u2019s Goose, breeds mainly in central and eastern arctic Canada and winters in the southern Great Plains, with small numbers found in eastern North America as well. This subspecies is paler still and usually lacks the white collar entirely. The largest subspecies, taverneri, is often called Taverner\u2019s Goose. It breeds from northeastern Alaska into Canada and winters in the southwestern U.S. This subspecies has a bit longer bill, on average, and is very similar to the smallest subspecies of Canada Goose (Lesser Canada Goose, subspecies parvipes). This close similarity\u2014and the hybridization of Cackling and Canada Geese in some areas\u2014justify using caution in identification of intermediate individuals, and \u201cCanada/Cackling Goose\u201d is often the best way to record these.",
