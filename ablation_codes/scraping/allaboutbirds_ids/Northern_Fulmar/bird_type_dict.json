            "Stocky gull-like seabird with a thick neck and a bull-headed appearance. Flies like a tank with stiff wingbeats. Varies in color from dark gray to nearly white. Note gray rump and tail on light morph birds.",
            "Like many seabird species of the high arctic, Northern Fulmars are highly opportunistic feeders. They often consume discarded fish from commercial fishing vessels, squid, crustaceans, and carrion.",
            "This light morph bird is white overall with gray wings and darker gray wingtips. Often rests on the water with other Northern Fulmars.",
            "Breeds on steep sea cliffs. Spends the winters at sea from ice-covered northern waters to temperate zones."
