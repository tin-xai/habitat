            "You\u2019ll most likely see Red-tailed Hawks soaring in wide circles high over a field. When flapping, their wingbeats are heavy. In high winds they may face into the wind and hover without flapping, eyes fixed on the ground. They attack in a slow, controlled dive with legs outstretched \u2013 much different from a falcon\u2019s stoop."

    "Regional_Difference": {
        "description": [
            "Red-tailed Hawks have extremely variable plumage, and some of this variation is regional. A Great Plains race called \"Krider's\" hawk is pale, with a whitish head and washed-out pink in the tail. Light-morph western birds tend to be more streaky on the underparts than eastern Red-tails; south Texas forms are darker above, without the dark belly band most other Red-tails have. Dark-morph birds can occur anywhere but are more common in western North America - particularly in Alaska and northwest Canada, where the all-dark \"Harlan's\" race is common."
