            "Canyon Wrens cling almost like nuthatches to rock walls, able to scale even vertical surfaces with ease. They generally move sideways or at an angle, a short distance at a time, securing themselves with the rear foot as they advance to the next foothold. They move deliberately and deftly, looking into crevices that might hold prey, which they extract with quick jabs of the fine bill. Males sing from favored rocky song perches, most regularly in spring and summer but occasionally in winter. Females sing on occasion.",
