            "These sparrows breed in wet meadows filled with willows, alders, and sedges. They also breed in patches of aspens, cottonwoods, and willows as well as shrubby areas near streams. During migration Lincoln's Sparrows use brushy fields, forest edges, and thickets. In winter, they use tropical forests, pine-oak forests, tropical scrub, weedy pastures, and shrubby fields."
