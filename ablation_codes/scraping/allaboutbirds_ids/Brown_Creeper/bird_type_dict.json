            "Tiny and delicate songbird. It has a long, spine-tipped tail, a slim body, and a slender, decurved bill. Its back is mottled brown and the underparts are white.",
            "Tiny with a long tail and a sharp, curved bill. Its cryptically colored back helps it blend in with the trees.",
            "Spirals up tree trunks holding its legs on either side of its body and its long, curved claws hooked into the bark. Braces itself with its stiff tail as it probes crevices for insects.",
            "",
            "Spirals up trees moving with short, jerky motions using their stiff tails for support.",
            "",
            "",
            "Found primarily in mature evergreen or mixed evergreen-deciduous forests during the breeding season."
