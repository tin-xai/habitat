            "Pine Warblers are yellowish birds with olive backs, whitish bellies, and two prominent white wingbars on gray wings. Adult males are the brightest; females and immatures are more subdued and can even appear gray-brown. Overall, Pine Warblers don\u2019t show the strong patterns of other warblers, but the face can look weakly \u201cspectacled,\u201d with a pale eyering connected to a pale stripe in front of the eye."

            "Pine Warblers are often difficult to see as they usually stay high up in pines. Insects make up most of their diet, but they also eat fruits and seeds. They occasionally forage on the ground or come to feeders. Males sing even, rich trills from the tops of pines."
