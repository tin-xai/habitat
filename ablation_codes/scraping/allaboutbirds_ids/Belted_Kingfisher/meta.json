            "Belted Kingfishers spend much of their time perched alone along the edges of streams, lakes, and estuaries, searching for small fish. They also fly quickly up and down rivers and shorelines giving loud rattling calls. They hunt either by plunging directly from a perch, or by hovering over the water, bill downward, before diving after a fish they\u2019ve spotted."

Kingfishers spend winters in areas where the water doesn\u2019t freeze so that they have continual access to their aquatic foods."
