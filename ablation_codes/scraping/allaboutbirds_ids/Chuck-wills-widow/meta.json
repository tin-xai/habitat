            "Warm brown tones with intricately patterned feathers make them extremely well-camouflaged. The wings are entirely brown; the outer tail feathers have white inner webs that you might see as one flushes from a roost or passes through your headlights. More often, you won't see white in the tail\u2014this helps separate it from Whip-poor-will, in which the white is more prominent."
