Adult females are similar in color but show variations in the amount of black on the top of the head, from a few blackish feathers to a small dark cap. Juvenile females have an olive crown and a yellow eyebrow."

            "Wilson\u2019s Warblers breed in mountain meadows and thickets near streams, especially those with willows and alders. They also breed along the edges of lakes, bogs, and aspen stands. Pacific Coast populations breed in shrubby habitat and in young stands of conifers, alders, or maples. During migration they use woodlands, suburban areas, desert scrub, and shrubby areas near streams."
