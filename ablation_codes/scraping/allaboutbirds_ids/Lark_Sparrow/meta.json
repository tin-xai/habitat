Chestnut and white stripes streak across the head, a black mustache runs down the sides of the throat, and the cheeks have chestnut spots. The outer tail feathers are tipped in white and a black spot marks the center of the chest. Juveniles have a ghosting of the adult's facial pattern and heavy streaking on the breast and flanks.",
