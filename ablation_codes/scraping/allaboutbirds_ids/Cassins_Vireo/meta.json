The lucasanus subspecies occurs only in southern Baja California, Mexico, and has a larger bill than cassinii. The cassinii form migrates, whereas lucasanus is a permanent resident in mountains at the tip of the Baja California Peninsula. As is expected in a migrant, the migratory subspecies has slightly longer wings than the sedentary lucasanus.",
