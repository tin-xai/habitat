            "Sandhill Cranes forage for grains and invertebrates in prairies, grasslands, and marshes. They do not hunt in open water or hunch their necks the way herons do. Sandhill Cranes form extremely large flocks\u2014into the tens of thousands\u2014on their wintering grounds and during migration. They often migrate very high in the sky."
