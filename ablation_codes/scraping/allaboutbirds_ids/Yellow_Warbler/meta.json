            "Yellow Warblers breed in shrubby thickets and woods, particularly along watercourses and in wetlands. Common trees include willows, alders, and cottonwoods across North America and up to about 9,000 feet in the West. In winter they mainly occur in mangrove forests of Central and South America."

        "description": [
            "Yellow Warblers differ only slightly across continental North America. Various subspecies that live year-round in the Caribbean and in mangrove forests of Central and South America have bright chestnut on the crown or over the entire head; these subspecies are often referred to as \u201cGolden\u201d or \u201cMangrove\u201d Yellow Warblers. There is a very small population of \u201cMangrove\u201d Yellow Warblers in extreme south Texas."
