            "Entirely black bird with a heavy bill and sturdy legs. Very slightly smaller than an American Crow.",
            "Often seen walking or skip-hopping along the ground while foraging.",
            "When calling from the ground, it often leans forward and fluffs up its neck feathers.",
            "",
            "In addition to eating fish and other plant and animal foods, they frequently raid nests, eating eggs and nestlings of colonial nesting waterbirds, terns, and gulls.",
            "Often walks along the ground. A unique wing tag and leg bands mark this individual, which allows researchers to track and monitor its behavior.",
            "Found along the coast and inland along major freshwater rivers and lakes. They use a wide variety of habitats often near water, including towns and cities near parks, docks, and landfills.",
            "Often found eating food scraps at garbage or compost piles. This individual has a wing tag and leg bands to help researchers monitor its behavior.",
