            "Breeding male Blackpoll Warblers are black-and-white with a distinctive black cap and white cheeks bordered by a black mustache stripe. Breeding females are streaky black, white, and gray, without the male\u2019s black cap or white cheek. Both sexes have two white wingbars and orange-yellow legs. In late summer they molt into a very different plumage: greenish-yellow above with dark streaking down the back and faint streaking on white underparts. The face is pale yellow with a dark eyeline."
